# Hybrid Method for Probabilistic Primary Key Identification

This project implements a hybrid system for probabilistic primary key identification in relational databases using heuristic filtering, attention-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning (RL).

## Project Structure
- **models/**: Contains the GNN model
- **scripts/**: Core scripts for connecting to the database, running heuristics,RL agent and executing the GNN.
- **main.py**: Entry point to run the full pipeline.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
